# Coupon Management System

## Overview

The Coupon Management System is a Go-based application that allows you to create, manage, and validate promotional coupons for marketing campaigns. It provides a flexible framework for generating coupons in bulk, associating them with campaigns, and applying custom validation rulesets to ensure coupon eligibility.

## Motivation

Marketing campaigns often leverage promotional coupons to attract and retain customers. However, managing coupons efficiently and ensuring their proper validation can be challenging. This system aims to simplify coupon management, making it easier for marketing teams to offer discounts and incentives.

## Use Cases

1. **Bulk Coupon Generation**: Create a batch of coupons with various configurations, such as discount types, expiration dates, and usage limits.

2. **Campaign Association**: Associate coupons with specific marketing campaigns, allowing you to track campaign performance.

3. **Validation Rules**: Define custom validation rulesets for coupons to ensure they meet eligibility criteria, such as minimum purchase requirements or customer age restrictions.

4. **Ruleset Flexibility**: Create and apply rulesets based on various parameters, such as order total, customer age, and more.

5. **Coupon Usage Tracking**: Track coupon redemptions, usage statistics, and campaign effectiveness.
